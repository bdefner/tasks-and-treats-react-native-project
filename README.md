# Tasks and Treats react native app

Welcome to my react native app project! This little tool is a get-things-done app with a twist.
The app is fired by the [Tasks and Treats backend project.](https://github.com/bdefner/tasks-and-treats-backend)

<!-- The app is currently in an alpha state. If you would like to run it, you will need the expo app. From there -->

## Technologies

React native, expo, expo-secure-store, lottie-react-native, react-native-ratings, react-native-reanimated, react-native-safe-area-contextreact-native-screens, react-native-web

## What you can do with the app

Users can create tasks and rate them between 1 - 10 stars. Once a task is done, these stars are collected in the users budget and can be traded against treats. These are also defined by the user and rated between 1 - 999 stars. Besides that, there are challenges, where users can earn or loose stars, according to their behavior in the app.
A future release is planned to add a chat-like function, where users can set up tasks and treats for other users.

## Current development and plans for further features

A major update will be the ability to share tasks and treat between users, in a chat-like manner. Besides their own budget of stars, users will have a budget of stars per other user, witch which their are connected to:

## Planning of the app

The wireframing and prototyping was done in [Figma](https://www.figma.com):

## Graphics and Icons in the app

The icons are mostly from [Heroicons](<https://www.figma.com/file/r6XjuG17QforQ9CavIKotW/Heroicons-(Community)?node-id=8%3A3823&t=2NYUwofaOZOIVDNC-1>), a few others are created using the [Affinity suite](https://affinity.serif.com/).

The story-graphics are based on [undraw/illustrations](https://undraw.co/illustrations), but modified using the [Affinity suite](https://affinity.serif.com/).
